* Improve look of progress widget

  - Decrease width of text field
  - Add some padding to the images
  - Prevent line break ("white-space: nowrap" on surrounding element)

* Maybe Title shouldn't be unique, or should be unique together with Type and/or Production type

* Disable or hide progress for movies?
* Lists (many-to-many with list class?)
* Rewatch date(s)?
* Complete history of progress changes?
* Javascript pop-up (kind of like Netflix) with item details?
