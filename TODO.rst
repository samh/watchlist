* Turn on USE_TZ (and migrate data)

* Ability to save filters (e.g. Anime, watching)

* To Get/To Watch like AniDB? (maybe best just use AniDB instead, or list on wiki)
* User-defined categories/tags? (needs to be many-to-many)
* Type could be FK to another table (allowing for user-defined types); each type could hide certain fields

* Maybe Title shouldn't be unique, or should be unique together with Type and/or Production type

* Disable or hide progress for movies?
* Lists (many-to-many with list class?)
* Rewatch date(s)?
* Complete history of progress changes?
* Javascript pop-up (kind of like Netflix) with item details?
